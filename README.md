# NetflixDataMining
This is a small project trying to get familiar with the concept of data mining, and the steps beforehand.

## Main Goal

My main goal was to get more familiar with the backbones of the data mining steps:
  - data cleaning
  - data exploration
  - data visualization

## Data Source

My source comes from kaggle.com which site provides many-many data for programmers to help them impore themselves.
I chose my file, which was the movies and tv-series on netflix.
I wanted to explore questions like, which are the most popular genre on the platform, and if there are significantly more films and series after the 2015 year, or not.

## Data cleaning

It wasn't easy to get the data to look like, what I can use, the main steps I followed were the one below:
  - check for null values and decide what to do with them
  - converting the data: movie_duration and series_count
  - checking if the data fits the permitted domain

## Data Exploration

Firstly I needed to find the outliers, then convert the numerical data to the same scale if needed, and try to find connections between attributes.

## Data Visulatization

After I explored the data I visualized the outcomes, and also beforehand the distribution of the data.
